            <img src="img/fibrew" width="750" height="500"></center>
        <p>Fibre is made up of the indigestible parts or compounds of plants, which pass relatively unchanged through our stomach and intestines.</p>
        <p>Fibre is mainly a carbohydrate. The main role of fibre is to keep the digestive system healthy. </p>
            <p>Other terms for dietary fibre include 'bulk' and 'roughage', which can be misleading since some forms of fibre are water-soluble and aren't bulky or rough at all.</p>
