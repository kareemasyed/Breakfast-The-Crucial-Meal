        <h3>What is Calcium</h3>
        <p>The average adult's weight is made up of about 2% calcium. Most of this is found in the skeleton and teeth - the rest is stored in the tissues or blood. Calcium is vital for healthy teeth and bones. It also plays a crucial role in other systems of the body, such as the health and functioning of nerves and muscle tissue.

        <p>Good sources of calcium include dairy foods like milk, yoghurt and cheese, and calcium-fortified products, such as some plant-based milks (for example, soy milk and rice milk) and breakfast cereals.</p>
        <p>It is much better to get calcium from foods than from calcium supplements. Be guided by your doctor about whether you need additional supplements. Too much calcium from supplements may cause other health problems.</p>
