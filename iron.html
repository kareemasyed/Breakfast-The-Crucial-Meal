        <h3>Summary    <a href="#factsheet">   Read the full fact sheet</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Iron is an important dietary mineral that is involved in various bodily functions, including the transport of oxygen in the blood.. </li><br>
            <li>Dietary iron is found in animal and plant foods. Iron deficiency can be treated by adding iron-rich foods to your diet.</li><br>
            <li>Iron deficiency is when your body's iron stores are too low. Common causes include not getting enough iron in your diet, chronic blood loss, pregnancy and vigorous exercise. </li><br>
            <li>Some foods and drinks affect how much iron your body absorbs</li><br>
            <li>If you have iron deficiency anaemia, your GP (doctor) may recommend iron supplements. Keep iron supplements away from babies and young children - overdoses can be fatal..</li>

        <h3>What is Iron</h3>
        <p>Iron is an important mineral that is involved in various bodily functions, including the transport of oxygen in the blood. This is essential for providing energy for daily life.</p>
        <p>Good sources of iron include red meat, offal and iron-fortified breakfast cereals.</p>

        <p>Iron is lost from the body through sweat, shedding intestinal cells, and blood loss. </p>
            <p>About one third of the world's population is iron deficient. Menstruating women are at greater risk than men and postmenopausal women of iron deficiency. It is thought that up to 5% of the Australian population has iron deficiency anaemia.</p>

       <h3>Role of Iron</h3>
       <p>Some of the many roles of iron in the body include:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><strong>Oxygen transport </strong>- red blood cells contain haemoglobin, a complex protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Haemoglobin is partly made from iron, and accounts for about two thirds of the body's iron</li><br>
        <li><strong>Myoglobin </strong>- a special protein that helps store oxygen in muscle cells. Myoglobin contains iron and is responsible for the red colour of muscle.</li><br>

        <br>
        <li><strong>Enzymes </strong>- many enzymes throughout the body contain iron, including those involved in energy production. Enzymes are catalysts (increase the rate of chemical reaction) that drive many cell functions.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Immune system</strong> - proper functioning of the immune system relies, in part, on sufficient iron. The immune system helps us fight infection.</li><br>

       <h3>Food sources for iron</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>Consume vitamin C (found in fruits and vegetables).</li><br>
        <li>Include animal protein with plant sources of iron, such as meat with beans â€“ for example, beef and kidney beans in a chilli con carne.</li><br>
        <li>Cook plant sources of iron (such as vegetables). In most cases, cooking increases the amount of available non-haem iron in vegetables. For example, the body absorbs 6% of the iron from raw broccoli, compared to 30% from cooked broccoli.</li><br>

        <br>
        <li><strong>Haem iron </strong>- found in animal tissue such as beef, lamb, kangaroo, chicken and fish. Offal products such as liver and kidney are particularly rich in haem iron (however pregnant women should avoid eating too much offal as it contains large amounts of vitamin A, which can cause birth defects). This form of iron is most easily absorbed by the body.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Non-haem iron </strong>- found in animal tissue, animal-based products and plant foods such as dried beans and lentils. Good vegetarian sources of non-haem iron include iron-fortified breakfast cereals, wholegrains and legumes (beans and lentils). If you are vegetarian and have no animal tissue in your diet, you may need almost twice as much dietary iron each day as non-vegetarians. Plant-based sources of iron include: dark green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, raisins, nuts, prunes, dried apricots, seeds, dried beans and peas, and iron-fortified cereals, breads and pastas.</li><br>
