    <h2>About breakfast</h2>
    <p>
        Breakfast is often called ‘the most important meal of the day’, and for good reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the name suggests, breakfast breaks the overnight fasting period. It replenishes your supply of glucose to boost your energy levels and alertness, while also providing other essential nutrients required for good health.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many studies have shown the health benefits of eating breakfast. It improves your energy levels and ability to concentrate in the short term, and can help with better weight management, reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease in the long term.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite the benefits of breakfast for your health and wellbeing, many people often skip it, for a variety of reasons. The good news is there are plenty of ways to make it easier to fit breakfast into your day.

<section id="why">
    <h2>Why breakfast is so important</h2>
    <p>
        When you wake up from your overnight sleep, you may not have eaten for up to 12 hours. Breakfast replenishes the stores of energy and nutrients in your body.
    </p>
    <h3>Energy</h3>
    <p>In the morning, after you have gone without food for as long as 12 hours, your glycogen stores are low. Once all of the energy from your glycogen stores is used up, your body starts to break down fatty acids to produce the energy it needs. But without carbohydrate, fatty acids are only partially oxidised, which can reduce your energy levels.</p>
    <p>Eating breakfast boosts your energy levels and restores your glycogen levels ready to keep your metabolism up for the day.</p>
    <center>
    <img src="img/People+starring+at+a+plate+thinking+about+the+importance+of+eating+breakfast.jpeg" alt="breakfast-crucial meal" width="750"></center>
    <h3>Essential vitamins, minerals and nutrients</h3>
    <p>Breakfast foods are rich in key nutrients such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>folate</li><br>
        <li><a href="calcium.html">calcium</a></li><br>
        <li><a href="iron.html">iron</a></li><br>
        <li><a href="fibre.html">fibre</a></li><br>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Breakfast provides a lot of your day's total nutrient intake. In fact, people who eat breakfast are more likely to meet their recommended daily intakes of vitamins and minerals than people who don't.
    </p>
    <p>
        Essential vitamins, minerals and other nutrients can only be gained from food, so even though your body can usually find enough energy to make it to the next meal, you still need to top up your vitamin and mineral levels to maintain health and vitality.

    <h2>Breakfast boosts brainpower</h2>
    <p>
        If you don't have breakfast, you might find you feel a bit sluggish and struggle to focus on things. This is because your brain hasn't received the energy (glucose) it needs to get going.
    </p>
    <p>
        Studies suggest that not having breakfast affects your mental performance, including your attention, ability to concentrate and memory. This can make some tasks feel harder than they normally would.

        Children and adolescents who regularly eat breakfast also tend to perform better academically compared with those who skip breakfast. They also feel a greater level of connectedness with teachers and other adults at their school, which leads to further positive health and academic outcomes.

        <h2>A healthy breakfast may reduce the risk of illness</h2>
        <p>Compared with people who don't have breakfast, those who regularly eat breakfast tend to have a lower risk of both obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p>
        <p>There is also some evidence that people who don't have breakfast may be at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>
            <p>
                People who eat breakfast generally have more healthy diets overall, have better eating habits and are less likely to be hungry for snacks during the day than people who skip breakfast.
            </p>

            <p>
                People who skip breakfast tend to nibble on snacks during the mid-morning or afternoon. This can be a problem if those snacks are low in fibre, vitamins and minerals, but high in fat and salt. Without the extra energy that breakfast can offer, some people feel lethargic and turn to high-energy food and drinks to get them through the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do skip breakfast, try a nutritious snack such as fresh fruit, yoghurt, veggie sticks and hummus, or a wholemeal sandwich to help you through that mid-morning hunger.

        <h2>Skipping breakfast</h2>
        <p>
            Skipping breakfast was shown to be common in the most recent national nutrition survey of Australian children and adolescents, although the majority did not skip breakfast consistently. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>are under or overweight</li><br>
            <li>have lower physical activity levels</li><br>
            <li>have a poor diet</li><br>
            </ul>
            <center>
            <img src="img/skip.webp" width="750"></center>
                <p>
                Some common reasons for skipping breakfast include:  
                </p>
            <ul>
            <li>not having enough time or wanting to spend the extra time being in bed</li><br>
            <li>trying to lose weight</li><br>
            <li>don't feel hungry in the morning</li><br>
            <li>bored of the same breakfast foods</li><br>

        <h2>If you're time poor you can still have breakfast</h2>
        <p>
            Early starts, long commutes and busy morning schedules mean many of us don’t make time to sit down to breakfast before heading out for the day. Whatever your reason for being time poor in the morning, there are still ways that you can fit in breakfast.
        </p>
        <center>
        <img src="img/time.webp" width="750"></center>
        <p><strong>Some ideas include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare some quick and healthy breakfast foods the night before or on the weekend, such as zucchini slice, healthy muffins or overnight oats (rolled oats soaked in milk overnight in the fridge – just add fruit/nuts and serve). A pre-prepared breakfast means you can grab it and eat at home, on the way to work or once you get to your destination.</li><br>
            <li>Keep some breakfast foods at work (if allowed) to enjoy once you arrive.</li><br> 
            <li>Get in the habit of setting your alarm for 10 to 15 minutes earlier than usual to give you time to have breakfast at home.</li><br>
            <li>Swap out any time-wasting habits in the morning (such as checking your emails or scrolling social media) and use this time for breakfast instead.
            </li><br>
            <li>Prepare for the next day the night before to free up time in the morning to have breakfast.</li><br>

        <h2>Can’t face food in the morning?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Some people find they just can’t tolerate food first thing in the morning – perhaps because they have their last meal of the day quite late at night or they don’t find typical breakfast foods appealing, or because food first thing in the morning turns their stomach.

        <img src="img/cant face.jpg" width="750"></center>
        <p>          
        <strong>If it’s hard for you to eat food first thing in the morning, you might like to try: </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>reducing the size of your meals in the evening and eating them earlier so you’re hungry in the morning</li><br>
            <li>investigating some new recipes and stocking your cupboards with some different types of foods to increase your breakfast appetite</li><br>
            <li>switching your breakfast to morning tea or mid-morning snack time instead – perhaps try some of the portable breakfast ideas listed above so you’ve got healthy options ready to go when you feel ready for your mid-morning breakfast.</li><br>
